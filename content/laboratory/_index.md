The Collaboratory is a browser-based IDE for ABS that offers an online, zero
install version of the ABS toolchain.  Use it to experiment with the language
in a risk-free environment.

Load our ready-made examples or run your own ABS models. The editor has many
features of an IDE, including showing you an outline of the code, and of
course reporting syntax- and type errors.

The collaboratory also supports many of the analysis tools that we have
developed, like COSTA and SACO.

A collaboratory instance is hosted online at
<http://ei.abs-models.org:8082/clients/web/>.  Please use this instance
responsibly, and consider running the collaboratory on your local machine.

To run a private local instance of the collaboratory, see [Running a Browser-Based IDE](/getting_started/docker/).
