## General Overview

We prototype a static analysis technique that computes upper bounds of virtual
machine usages in a dialect of ABS, called vml, whose syntax will be covered
by the examples in this tutorial, with explicit acquire and release operations
of virtual machines.  In our language it is possible to delegate other (ad-hoc
or third party) concurrent code to release virtual machines (by passing them
as arguments of invocations).  Our technique is modular and consists of (i) a
type system associating programs with behavioural types that records relevant
information for resource usage (creations, releases, and concurrent
operations), (ii) a translation function that takes behavioural types and
return cost equations.  It is integrated with the solver CoFloCo that given
the cost equations produces the result.

## Resource Analysis

In this section we present how to compute the cost of a vml program in term of
virtual machine usage.

First, select `Resource Analysis (SRA)` from the pull-down menu at the top of
the window on the center-left.  The parameters of the selected analysis are
automatically set, so there is nothing to be configured in the `Settings`
section in the top-left corner.

As an example, open the program {{< eifilelink app="sra" path="/collaboratory/review_2nd_year/sra/doubleRelease.vml" >}}:

```
/* DOUBLE RELEASE */
Int doubleRelease(VM x, VM y) {
  release x; release y;
  return 0 ;
}

Int user1() {
  VM x ; VM y ; Fut<Int> f ;
  x = new VM() ; y = new VM();
  f = this!doubleRelease(x, y);
  Int a = f.get ; return 0 ; 
}

{
  Fut<Int> fuser1 = this!user1();
  Int a = fuser1.get;
}
```

Let us analyze the program. Click on `Run` to perform the analysis.

The output of the analysis is shown in three tabs of the console, which are
generated by the tool:

* **Types** contains the behavioural types generated for the input program
* **Equations** contains the cost equations resulted by the translation of the
  behavioural types
* **UBs** which is the overall output and shows the upper bounds. For the
  `doubleRelease.vml` we get:
  
```
### Partitioned upper bound of main(MAINVM):
* 2
 if []

### Partitioned upper bound of doubleRelease012net(THISVM,X,Y):
* -2
 if [THISVM=1,X=1,Y=1]
* -1
 if [THISVM=1,X=1,Y>=2]
 or [THISVM=1,Y=1,X>=2]
* 0
 if [THISVM=1,X>=2,Y>=2]
 or [THISVM=3]

### Partitioned upper bound of user10net(THISVM):
* 0
 if [3>=THISVM,THISVM>=1]

### Partitioned upper bound of doubleRelease012peak(THISVM,X,Y):
* 0
 if [X=1,Y=1,2>=THISVM]
* 0
 if [X=1,2>=THISVM,Y>=2]
 or [Y=1,2>=THISVM,X>=2]
 or [X=1,2>=THISVM,0>=Y]
* 0
 if [2>=THISVM,X>=2,Y>=2]
 or [2>=THISVM,0>=Y,X>=2]
 or [3>=THISVM,0>=X]
 or [THISVM=3,X>=1]

### Partitioned upper bound of user10peak(THISVM):
* 0
 if [THISVM=3]
* 2
 if [2>=THISVM]
```
